AMERICAN DIABETES ASSOCIATION - STANDARDS OF CARE (SYNTHETIC EXCERPT)

SECTION 1: GLYCEMIC TARGETS
For most nonpregnant adults with diabetes:
- Fasting plasma glucose: 80-130 mg/dL
- Peak postprandial glucose: <180 mg/dL
- HbA1c: <7.0%

RED FLAG THRESHOLDS:
- Fasting glucose >250 mg/dL requires immediate medical attention
- Glucose <70 mg/dL indicates hypoglycemia risk
- Persistent readings >180 mg/dL require healthcare provider consultation

SECTION 2: NUTRITION THERAPY
Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT) is recommended for all people with diabetes.

CARBOHYDRATE RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Emphasize low glycemic index foods
- Limit refined carbohydrates and added sugars
- Monitor carbohydrate intake for glucose management
- Avoid sugar-sweetened beverages

FIBER RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Minimum 25-30g per day
- Emphasize whole grains, legumes, vegetables, fruits
- Soluble fiber helps improve glycemic control

FOODS TO EMPHASIZE:
- Non-starchy vegetables
- Whole grains (brown rice, quinoa, oats)
- Legumes (lentils, chickpeas, beans)
- Nuts and seeds
- Low-fat dairy or alternatives
- Lean proteins
- Healthy fats (olive oil, avocado)

FOODS TO LIMIT:
- Refined carbohydrates (white bread, white rice)
- Sugary beverages and desserts
- Processed foods high in sodium
- Saturated and trans fats
- Fried foods

SECTION 3: PHYSICAL ACTIVITY
Adults with diabetes should engage in 150 minutes or more of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week, spread over at least 3 days per week, with no more than 2 consecutive days without activity.

AEROBIC ACTIVITY:
- 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity activity
- Examples: brisk walking, cycling, swimming
- Can be broken into 10-minute segments

RESISTANCE TRAINING:
- 2-3 sessions per week on non-consecutive days
- Include all major muscle groups
- Start with light weights and progress gradually

FLEXIBILITY AND BALANCE:
- Stretching exercises 2-3 times per week
- Balance exercises for older adults

SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS:
- Check glucose before, during, and after exercise
- Carry fast-acting carbohydrate source
- Stay hydrated
- Avoid exercise if glucose >250 mg/dL with ketones
- For sedentary individuals, start slowly and progress gradually

SECTION 4: GLUCOSE MONITORING
Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) should be performed by patients on intensive insulin regimens or those with a history of hypoglycemia.

MONITORING FREQUENCY:
- Fasting glucose: Daily for most patients
- Post-meal glucose: 1-2 hours after meals
- Before exercise if on insulin or sulfonylureas

PATTERN RECOGNITION:
- Track trends over days and weeks
- Identify patterns related to meals, activity, stress
- Adjust care plan based on consistent patterns

SECTION 5: PSYCHOSOCIAL CARE
Assess psychological and social situation as part of ongoing diabetes management.

SECTION 6: DISCLAIMER
These are general guidelines. Individual treatment plans must be developed by qualified healthcare professionals based on comprehensive patient assessment. This information is not medical advice and does not replace consultation with healthcare providers.
